		<h1>Hi people</h1>
		<p>
			Following the Almeida Theatre’s critically acclaimed, sold-out run, Sonia Friedman Productions transfers Rebecca Frecknall’s ‘shiveringly beautiful production’ (The Sunday Times) of Tennessee Williams’ Summer and Smoke to the West End’s Duke of York’s Theatre for a strictly limited season.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trapped between desire and a life of obligation, Alma meets John and her world turns upside down.  With ‘spellbinding, stripped-back staging’ (Financial Times), this intoxicating classic about love, loneliness and self-destruction evokes the simmering passions of a sweltering summer in small-town Mississippi.  ‘Patsy Ferran is a genuine marvel’ as Alma (The Independent) and Matthew Needham ’fires up the stage’ (The Times) as John in this ‘unmissable Tennessee Williams revival’ (The Telegraph).
		</p>
		<p>
			This innovative and ‘exquisite, poignant production’ (Financial Times) ‘announces ‘Rebecca Frecknall as a director of real vision‘ (The Independent).
		Please note this production features a gun shot and the smoking of real cigarettes.
		</p>
		<p>Now go build something great.</p>
